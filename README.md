# Election_Analysis\
#(this needs to be edited- I have been very sick the previous two weeks and require more time to complete this project)
#The Purpose of this analysis is to utilize dictionaries, lists, for loops and logical connectives to perform an election audit consisting of thousands of votes cast for various candidates in the Denver, Colorado area.  Through analysis we can find out who the winning candidate was for each county and by what percentage and total raw votes the candidate won by.  I had some issues organizing the dictionary unforunately so my code is essentially broken as it stands and I am too ill to debug currently but here is what I have.  I seem to have some issues in referencing county_votes from my csv file which is unfortunate.  
#This script however is useful for most types of elections that feature a county and a candidate by name.  The script could be used for a much larger election audit featuring many many more candidates and also features a line to create a new entry in the dictionary if a candidate is written in.  Additionally one could modify the output in the terminal or the text file to have more indept analysis of each voting counties' demographic and general sway for one candidate or another by assigning a positive or negative 1 for every vote received in a particular county, then summing all of the integers to find a "raw sway" score, which could be divided by the total number of votes to give a general idea of how each county tends to vote.
